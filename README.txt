Squids of the Galaxy for iPhone
--------------------------------
Created using the cocos2d game engine and SneakyInput.
Based around the sample shoot 'em up game from 'Learn iPhone and iPad cocos2d Game Development'.

You will need cocos2d installed to compile this game. Visit learn-cocos2d.com for information and a link to the latest version.

The game uses a virtual joystick on the bottom left corner of the screen to control the ship and a button on the right side of the screen to fire.
Shoot enemies to gain points.
Collect '?' crates for powerups.

I started work on this iPhone game after I finished my university semester in 2011. I planned to create a full game, but have since abandoned the project. I plan to complete my full vision of Squids of the Galaxy using Unity3D. I am not a good enough artist to complete the project to the standard I wanted!

I delved back into the code today to make it compatible on iOS 6, however there is a bug in the cocos2d framework that makes it rotate when it shouldn't on lower iOS version devices.
